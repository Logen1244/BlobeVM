Regulations — Use Rules and Compliance

This file defines the project's expected rules of use, responsible disclosure process, and redistribution requirements.

Legal compliance
- You are responsible for complying with all applicable local, national, and international laws and export-control rules, including those governing cryptography or specialized software.

Prohibited uses
- Do not use this project to create, distribute, or facilitate malware, ransomware, spyware, or any activity intended to cause harm, disrupt services, or exploit others.
- Do not use this project to intrude into, exfiltrate, or otherwise access data or systems without explicit authorization.

Privacy and data protection
- Do not use this project to collect, exfiltrate, or expose personal or sensitive data without proper authorization. Follow applicable privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) where relevant.

Intellectual property
- Respect copyrights, trademarks, and third-party rights. Do not distribute copyrighted material without proper rights or permission.

Responsible disclosure
- If you discover a security vulnerability, do not exploit it. Contact the maintainers through GitHub security advisories, open an issue, or use the repository's configured security contact if available.
- Suggested disclosure process and timelines:
  - Acknowledge: We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days.
  - Triage plan: We aim to respond with a tentative plan and timeline within 14 days.
  - Remediation and disclosure: We prefer coordinated disclosure and will work to publish a fix before public disclosure. If a fix is not possible within a reasonable period, we may publish a public advisory after 90 days unless the maintainer sets an alternate timeline.
  - Escalation: If you need to contact maintainers privately and the repository has no Security Policy configured, indicate that in your report and we will provide a preferred contact method.

Authorized environments and testing
- Test the project in disposable or isolated environments (virtual machines, containers) when possible and do not run code on production systems unless you have permission and understand the impacts.

No circumvention
- Do not attempt to bypass authentication, enforcement, or protection mechanisms in ways that are unethical, illegal, or dangerous.

Redistribution
- If you redistribute or modify this project, include this file (or a copy), the license, and the disclaimer in the README. Do not claim endorsement by the original authors without explicit permission.

Enforcement and consequences
- Maintainers may take actions against users who abuse the project, including revoking access, reporting abuse to hosting providers, removing published changes, or pursuing legal remedies if appropriate.

Contact and further questions
- If you have any questions about these regulations, open an issue or use the repository's issue tracker.

Disclaimer
- These regulations complement the project's main README and do not replace legal agreements or licenses. They are not a substitute for legal advice.
